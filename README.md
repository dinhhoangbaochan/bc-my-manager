# FINANCE MANAGER - AN APPLICATION TO MANAGE YOUR SPENDING THROUGHOUT THE MONTH

The context of this application: Over the last few months, I've been spending my money like a foking crazy motherfoker. So, in order to manage, double check what I have spent,
I decided to make a financial application, which can record my spending... or any foking feature that I can think of in the future.

# Requirements

This project is built by NuxtJS and (of course) VueJS. So, you need to take a look at the VueJS & NuxtJS document first.
Oh, and also, I deploy this to my Vercel.

## Setup

Clone the project, then install.

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Deploy Your Own

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```
